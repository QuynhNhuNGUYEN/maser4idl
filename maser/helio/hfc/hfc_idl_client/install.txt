  HFC client for IDL (v0.1)
 --------------------
 X.Bonnin, 19-AUG-2013

 Before using the hfc client, be sure you have the following
 softwares correctly installed on your operating system:
 	   - IDL 7.x or later
	   - wget 1.12 or later
           
 An internet access is also required to query the HFC.

 To install the hfc client: 
 
	1 - If it is not done yet, copy the current directory 
	      (it should be named "hfc_client" by default)  
  	      on the machine where you want to run the hfc client.

	2 - Depending on your shell, from the /setup sub-directory
	execute the following command:
		for csh/tcsh shell --> source hfc_idl_client_setup.csh
		for bash/sh shell --> source hfc_idl_client_setup.sh

  	3 - From the /scripts sub-directory, execute the 
 	      following command line:
	      		idl -e @make_bin.batch

	If everything is ok, a binary file called
	'hfc_client.sav' must be created in the /bin sub-directory.
	If it is not, please contact the HFC team!
	
	To learn how to call the hfc client routines using
  	the binary file, read the howto.txt file.
