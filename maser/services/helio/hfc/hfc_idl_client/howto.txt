  How to use the
  HFC client for IDL (v0.1)
 --------------------
 X.Bonnin, 19-AUG-2013

 To use the HFC client IDL library, just restore
 the routines saved in the 'hfc_client.sav'
 binary file. (This file should be found in the /bin 
 sub-directory, if it is not read the install.txt file
 to create it.)

 To do it from the IDL interpreter, just enter the following command line:

    RESTORE,path_to_the_file+'hfc_client.sav',/VERBOSE

  , where path_to_the_file is a string variable containing 
  the path to the hfc_client.sav file directory (not required
  if you are already in the /bin sub-directory).

  Examples of how to use routines can be read in the usecases.txt file.

  Notes: - If the 'hfc_client.sav' binary file does not exist
  	   in the /bin sub-directory, please read the
 	   install.txt file first.
	 - It is also possible to call routines by compiling
	   all of the source files in the /src directory from 
	   the IDL interpreter.
